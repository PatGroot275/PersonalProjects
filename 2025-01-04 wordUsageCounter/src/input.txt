My background as a Christian, tech-focused, IB student has influenced the problems I choose, the people I work with, and the impact I’d like to have.

A passion for tech and a desire to serve at church has led me to a church IT group, where the work challenged me to solve problems in a structured, professional manner. By handling some manual work for the team, I helped to reduce their ticket count and enable progress on larger projects, which I also engaged in. Networking, system management, and hands-on repairs were all tasks I was exposed to and enjoyed. Solving these issues inspired me to seek out more skill-challenging, tech opportunities.

As a determined student, joining the IB Diploma Program became another part of my journey. Within this program, I knew I would be exposed to academic rigor and surrounded by other students with a similar drive for excellence, propelled by different backgrounds and perspectives. These differences became apparent in our IB History, IB English, and AP Government classes, where we’ve been encouraged to debate and discuss ideas. One example of these differences became apparent in our IB Computer Science class, where we were instructed to create a blackjack card game project in code. I, being somewhat versed in coding, was asked for help by other students and got to see how they approached their code. Seeing these different approaches to the same goal allowed me to understand the value of multiple perspectives in finding the most effective solution. I am determined to strive for these nuanced experiences with others to build my outlook on the world. 

Finally, my Christian background has pushed me to aim for both wide and deep impacts. I’ve become comfortable volunteering in the IT group at my church which has helped many parts of the church function. To do more, I took part in the Mexico Outreach trip where I worked with a group of students and adults to build a house for a family in need. Although this wasn't tech-related, it aligned with my goal of having an impact. I spent time working on the construction of the house and listening to what the family had been experiencing and what the house meant to them. This encouraged me to seek deep and wide impacts, not just on mission trips, but in everyday encounters. The effect I want to have, the people I want to work with, and the problems I want to approach have been affected by my context as a Christian, IB student, and being tech-focused. I am excited to push the boundaries of technical problems, have a more open outlook with better connections, and have a wide and deep impact on the issues I solve.
