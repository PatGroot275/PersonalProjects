      <h3>Here's a time line of Khalil Gibran's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1883</strong> - Gibran is born in Besharri, a town in what is now northern Lebanon that is surrounded by the famed "Cedars of Lebanon".</li>
        <li><strong>1895</strong> - After his father is imprisoned in Besharri for corruption,Gibran's mother and her four children emigrate to Boston in hopes of escaping misery. Kahlil shows talent at drawing and, at age 12, begins to learn English.</li>
        <li><strong>1931</strong> - Gibran dies in a New York hospital. The New York Sun announces in its obituary, "A Prophet is Dead." His body is shipped back to Lebanon, and an immense procession follows his coffin from Beirut to Besharri.</li>
      </ul>
